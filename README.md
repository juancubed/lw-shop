## Description

Mock of a Mobile App of a Store that shows any type of products and allows the user to choose among product variations to add to a cart, and then confirm a purchase. 
The list of products is obtained by making a request to a public Store API (https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/) 
The products are modified upon response to comply with the requirement of the variations.
